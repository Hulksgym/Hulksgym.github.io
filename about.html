 <div id="about">
    <strong>We are the gym with the largest exercise area in Brno</strong> , which is based on quality machinery to practice all body parts. We have the largest crossfit trapeze, exercise on the outdoor grassy patio, and a separate ladder trapeze for self-weighted exercise. Plenty of machines for cardio exercises. We strive for maximum utilization of the mirror room with professional <strong>tatami</strong> for indoor lessons for judo, jiu jitsu, pilates, TRX, boxing, various kinds of martial arts, etc. We also do not forget the lessons for seniors. 
<strong>Parking</strong> is available directly in front of the establishment, there are two car parks guarded by camera system. For <strong>cyclists</strong> we offer parking bikes on the terrace with racks, all with lockable.<br> 
On arrival you will be welcomed by a pleasant sitting at the bar with <strong>WIFI</strong> connection , but also outdoor seating in front of the shop and rest on the terrace overlooking Brno.<br> 
Now all you have to do is choose the path and follow it to your dream destination. But the question is what is more important to you, whether it is a journey or a destination. For me it was always the most important way, I think it is not important where you go, but how you get there.<br> <br>
And finally, <strong>why HULK?</strong> HULK is an expression of size and strength. And our gym is <strong>HULK between the gyms</strong> .</div><br><br><br>
